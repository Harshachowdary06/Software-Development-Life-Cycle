**Software Developer Life Cycle**
                                    It is a step-by-step process that is followed to develop high-quality software in a structured and  efficient way.

    **SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**.

It is a **step-by-step process** that is followed to **develop high-quality software** in a structured and efficient way.

### üîÅ **Main Steps in SDLC (Simple Explanation)

1. **Requirement Gathering**
   ‚û§ The needs of the users are collected.
   ‚û§ What the software should do is clearly understood.

2. **Analysis**
   ‚û§ The gathered requirements are studied.
   ‚û§ Technical and financial feasibility is checked.

3. **Design**
   ‚û§ A blueprint of how the software will look and work is created.
   ‚û§ This includes architecture, UI design, database design, etc.

4. **Development (Coding)**
   ‚û§ Actual coding is done here.
   ‚û§ Developers write code to create the system.

5. **Testing**
   ‚û§ The software is tested to find and fix errors.
   ‚û§ It ensures that the software works as expected.

6. **Deployment**
   ‚û§ The final product is installed on users' systems.
   ‚û§ It is made live for actual use.

7. **Maintenance**
   ‚û§ Regular updates and bug fixes are done.
   ‚û§ New features can be added if needed.

### ‚úÖ Purpose of SDLC

* To ensure software is built **on time**, **within budget**, and **with expected quality**.
