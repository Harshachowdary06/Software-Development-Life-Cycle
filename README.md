# Software-Development-Life-Cycle

    **SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**.

It is a **step-by-step process** that is followed to **develop high-quality software** in a structured and efficient way.

---

### 🔁 **Main Steps in SDLC 

1. **Requirement Gathering**
   ➤ The needs of the users are collected.
   ➤ What the software should do is clearly understood.

2. **Analysis**
   ➤ The gathered requirements are studied.
   ➤ Technical and financial feasibility is checked.

3. **Design**
   ➤ A blueprint of how the software will look and work is created.
   ➤ This includes architecture, UI design, database design, etc.

4. **Development (Coding)**
   ➤ Actual coding is done here.
   ➤ Developers write code to create the system.

5. **Testing**
   ➤ The software is tested to find and fix errors.
   ➤ It ensures that the software works as expected.

6. **Deployment**
   ➤ The final product is installed on users' systems.
   ➤ It is made live for actual use.

7. **Maintenance**
   ➤ Regular updates and bug fixes are done.
   ➤ New features can be added if needed.

---------------------------------

###  Purpose of SDLC

* To ensure software is built **on time**, **within budget**, and **with expected quality**.

### EXAMPLE[Scenario Based Explination]

You want to develop a software that is either a large scale application or a simple application that serves some purpose we first need to gather all the requirements such as its software, its actions etc. for example you want to make a basic caluclator app that performs addition, substraction, etc. such that you gather all the requiremnts needed for software.


    *** requrement Gathering -> Analysis -> Design -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance -> ***
the cycle itself repeats
